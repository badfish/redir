This module is a continuation of the 'redir' module
that was provided with previous version of 'avfs'.
The latter stopped working when the kernel no
longer exported the 'sys_call_table' symbol.

In the current code we make use of two possible methods
for obtaining the address of the system call table:

1. The kallsyms_lookup_name() function will give us the
address of any public symbol in the kernel. This depends on
the kernel being compiled with 'CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y', but this
is the case for all the (debian-based) kernels I have examined.

2. The i386 kernel does not expose the sys_call_table
symbol, even to kallsyms_lookup_name(), so we search
for it in the code of the int 80 handler. I have
tried to find similar code for other architectures
in case the public symbol disappears from them too.

Usage
=====

1. Mount the avfs file system on /.avfs (see the mountavfs
script). The mount point /.avfs is currently hard-coded
in the redir module: I changed it from /overlay
as I was using that for something else.

2. Load the module.

3. Source the avfsfuse.sh script thusly:
	. ./avfsfuse.sh
and then use the commamds 'avfs-on' and 'avfs-off' to turn it on and off.

Then you can type things like:
	ls test.tar#
to view the contents of a tar file, even outside of the avfs mount.
